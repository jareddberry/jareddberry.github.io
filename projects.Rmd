### Teaching Introductory R

[Introduction to R Presentation (Beamer Presentation)](files/intro_to_R.pdf)
[Introduction to R script](files/intro_to_R.R)

This is the second year I've had the privilege of teaching R at Johns Hopkins SAIS during the Winter Intercession that is run for the MIEF cohort (from which I am alum). The structure of the intercession is designed to provide brief, intensive, skills-based courses to the cohort, covering a wide-range of topics including programming languages, investing, infrastructure finance, etc. I've used the presentation materials to teach R in this setting, as well as to teach R to incoming RAs at the Fed in the Monetary Affairs division. The emphasis is on the basics, and getting up to speed on data cleaning and manipulation using `dplyr`. While the presentation is well-organized, the R script is more a stream-of-conciousness exercise that I work through alongside the presentation to demonstrate working through the commands directly in the R Studio environment.

### Home Credit Default Risk (Kaggle)

[Download Jupyter notebook](files/hcd_notebook.ipynb)

Home Credit Default Risk was my first "real" competition on Kaggle. This notebook was truly built from the ground-up with no pre-existing structure to get things started, and I learned alot by struggling through the competition. I opted not to post an official kernel on the competition site on Kaggle because, amidst all my travel over the summer while the competition as live, I didn't have time to annotate my work in a way that I felt made it helpful for others. I've posted it here instead to walk through the work I did in the competition.

### The Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)

While I have no definitive proof of this, the Titanic dataset hosted on Kaggle is likely one of the most ubiquitous datasets in the field, largely because it's such a common place for folks to take their first stab at an end to end data science project. I'm no exception - the Titanic dataset is an excellent place to start for a manageable first project, from EDA to running initial classification models. I took advantage of this by building out a fairly involved analysis of the dataset, demonstrating some useful techniques for exploring and visualizing data, as well as applying, evaluating, and comparing a number of workhorse machine learning models to tackle the underlying classification problem.

### Monte Carlo Analysis in Excel (Audi Case Study)

[Audi US Expansion Case Study Presentation](files/audi_expansion_monte_carlo_case_study.pdf)
[Monte Carlo Model (Excel Download)](files/monte_carlo_model.xlsx)

The presentation, and accompanying Excel workbook, are the culmination of a semester-long project to develop a Monte Carlo model that robustly models the possible states of the world facing Audi in deciding how to best expand into the US market in the coming years. Using assumptions generated from publically available information and reading, and using Monte Carlo analysis, we attempted to create a toy model of the U.S. economy, particularly as it related to a foreign auto maker, and allow the user to specify assumptions in a dashboard to directly compare a number of strategies. The workbook is fairly large (~13Mb) and will be downleaded by clicking the link above. New assumptions can be processed with the underlying Monte Carlo machinery using the `CTRL-n` shortcut. We do not represent Audi in any way - all opinions and analysis are our own, and are generated using publically available data at the time of writing (Spring 2017).
