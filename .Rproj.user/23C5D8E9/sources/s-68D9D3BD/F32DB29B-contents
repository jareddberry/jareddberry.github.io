### Building heatmaps in R with dplyr and ggplot2

[Heatmaps in R](files/heatmaps_in_r.html)

For my inaugural post in this blog of tutorials, musings on data science and data analytics, and (what I hope to be) interesting explorations of new datasets, I'm revisiting one of the first challenges I came up against in my time as an analyst at the Board. I didn't fully appreciate the power of R prior to working through this exercise, and was blown away by how simple it can be to build incredible visualizations in R. This is a brief tutorial using the dplyr and ggplot2 libraries to work through the process of cleaning a poorly-formatted dataset and harness the power of the ggplot2 library to turn that data into a geographical heatmap of the United States, at the *county* level.
