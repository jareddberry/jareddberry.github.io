I like to distill insights from financial, economic, and public opinion data. I currently work as a data scientist at [Morning Consult](https://morningconsult.com/) in Washington, D.C., where I help clients leverage public opinion data to make better decisions. Previously, I investigated questions related to bank lending and monetary policy as a Senior Research Assistant at the [Federal Reserve Board](https://www.federalreserve.gov/), where I contributed to division research (chiefly related to interest rates, bank lending standards, and financial conditions) and operationalized new and existing data sources into production-ready monitors. 

I graduated from the [Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies](https://www.sais-jhu.edu/mief#overview) (SAIS) with a masters degree in International Economics and Finance (MIEF) in 2017, a rigorous, STEM-accredited quantitative econometrics program. During my graduate studies, I worked as a research assistant for Dr. Jaime Marquez using Monte Carlo methods and FIML models to investigate interdependent Taylor Rules. I also hold a [Certificate in Data Science](https://scs.georgetown.edu/programs/375/certificate-in-data-science/) from Georgetown University.

I work in both Python and R interchangeably in my work, but I am first and foremost an avid R enthusiast. I teach an introductory R course to students in the MIEF program at SAIS and have taught introductory R as a part of onboarding new division RAs at the Board.
