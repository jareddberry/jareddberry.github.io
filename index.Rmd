I like to distill insights from financial and economic data. I investigate questions related to bank lending and monetary policy as a Senior Research Assistant at the [Federal Reserve Board](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) in Washington, D.C, where I contribute to division research and operationalize new and existing data sources into production-ready monitors. 

I graduated from the [Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies](http://www.sais-jhu.edu/mief#overview) (SAIS) with a masters degree in International Economics and Finance (MIEF) in 2017, a rigorous, STEM-accredited quantitative econometrics program. During my graduate studies, I worked as a research assistant for Dr. Jaime Marquez using Monte Carlo methods and FIML models to investigate interdependent Taylor Rules.

While my work requires proficiency in a number of statistical computing and programming languages, I am first and foremost an avid R enthusiast. I teach an introductory R course to students in the MIEF program at SAIS and have taught R as a part of onboarding new division RAs at the Board.

My resume is available [here](files/berry_cv.pdf).
